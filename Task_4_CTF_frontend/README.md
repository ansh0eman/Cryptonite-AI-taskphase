# Deep Learning CTF Challenge

Welcome to the **Cat Detection CTF Challenge**! This challenge involves working with a deep learning model designed to detect cat images. The challenge tests your ability to reverse-engineer the model and extract a hidden flag embedded within its activation functions.

## About the Repo
This repository contains a React+Vite frontend that serves as the interface for the CTF Challenge. The frontend includes the challenge description, hints, necessary files, and a submission box for the flag.

### How to Use This Frontend
1. **View the Challenge:** The top section provides a description of the challenge.
2. **Access Hints:** Hints are spread across the page to help you solve the challenge.
3. **Download Files:** The middle column includes a box with all the necessary files (model in `.h5` and `.keras` formats) to start working on the challenge.
4. **Submit Your Flag:** After retrieving the flag from the model, enter it in the textbox provided below the files to check if it is correct.

## Note 
This repository contains only the website for accessing and playing the challenge. For detailed description on the CTF challenge itself, please refer to *[this repository](https://github.com/ansh0eman/Cryptonite-AI-taskphase/tree/main/Task_4_CTF)
